# Graph-Clustering-in-C-
GRAPH CLUSTERING ALGORITHM in C++. The algorithm uses the Quality function by Girvan-Newman to implement the clustering.                ->quality function Q=(conn_edges(cluster1,cluster2)/m)-(dccluster[cluster1]*dccluster[cluster2])/(m*m);                  where conn_edges(C1,C2) returns the number of connecting edges between cluster C1 and cluster C2                     and dccluster[C1] stores the sum of degrees of each vertex in cluster C1.                  At every step, only those clusters are merged which give highest rise to the quality value Q.
