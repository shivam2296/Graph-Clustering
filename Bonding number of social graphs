Bonding number(d) is the smallest integer‘d’ such that every person staying in touch with at least‘d’ others guarantees the connectivity of the group.

We want to find lower bounds on the bonding number. The following is a simple strategy based on clustering:
1. Find a clustering of the graph G.
2. For each cluster Ci, let Hi be the disconnected graph formed by deleting edges between Ci and the rest of G.
3. Find the maximum value of d such that some Hi is d-bonded.
4. Output d + 1 as a lower bound on τ (G).

As we can see, a major part of the solution demanded clustering the graph. 
I implemented the Girvan-Newman graph clustering algorithm from scratch(https://github.com/shivam2296/Graph-Clustering/blob/master/clustering_shivam.cpp)
